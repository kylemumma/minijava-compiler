For this part of compiler, much of our code generation required on using the DFS algorithm to set up locations for all variables properly, especially in the case
of extended classes. This allowed us to traverse classes in a topographical order so that we can set up vtables, overrided methods, inherited fields properly the first time.
Additionally, we made use of instance variables in our visitor class like currClass for the symbol table of the class we are currently in which is helpful for This.
Additionally, we had callClass variable which contained the current variable we are about to call a function from which was set in the This, IdentifierExp, and New.

We made many changes on old parts, mainly adding fields like offset to the "Type" classes. This made it easy to figure out exactly where to put access, place a value when
doing anything with identifiers. These were set in our MethodVisitor that we used for semantics.

Unfortunately, Kyle fell sick with COVID for the project, but he was still able to put in a decent bit of work.
